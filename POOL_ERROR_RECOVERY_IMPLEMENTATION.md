# Pool Processing Error Recovery and Reliability Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 6: "Add Pool Processing Error Recovery and Reliability" from the auto-assignment critical fixes specification.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Pool Error Recovery Manager (`lib/assignment/pool-error-recovery.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Implements configurable retry attempts (default: 3) with exponential backoff delays (base: 1000ms, max: 30000ms)
- **Error Isolation**: Individual entry failures don't block batch processing of other entries
- **Corruption Detection**: Comprehensive detection of corrupted pool entries with severity classification
- **Fallback to Immediate Assignment**: When pool processing consistently fails, entries are processed immediately
- **Health Checks**: System health monitoring with database connectivity, pool integrity, and performance metrics

**Key Methods:**
- `processWithErrorRecovery()`: Main processing method with comprehensive error handling
- `processEntryWithRetry()`: Individual entry processing with exponential backoff
- `detectEntryCorruption()`: Corruption detection with severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- `cleanupCorruptedEntry()`: Automated cleanup and recovery of corrupted entries
- `fallbackToImmediateProcessing()`: Fallback mechanism for consistently failed entries
- `performHealthCheck()`: Comprehensive system health assessment
- `getPoolProcessingStatus()`: Status monitoring with error recovery information

### 2. Enhanced Pool Engine (`lib/assignment/pool-engine.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Integrated error recovery system into all processing methods
- Enhanced status monitoring with error recovery information
- Corruption detection for entries needing processing
- Health check integration for immediate processing decisions
- Error recovery result conversion and tracking

**Updated Methods:**
- `processReadyEntries()`: Now uses error recovery for threshold processing
- `processDeadlineEntries()`: Enhanced with error recovery for deadline processing
- `processEmergencyOverride()`: Maximum error recovery for emergency situations
- `getProcessingStatus()`: Includes error recovery health and statistics
- `getEntriesNeedingProcessing()`: Enhanced with corruption detection and recovery stats

### 3. Enhanced Daily Pool Processor (`lib/assignment/daily-pool-processor.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Integrated error recovery manager for health checks before processing
- Enhanced error handling and recovery during daily processing
- Health check warnings and issue reporting
- Error recovery statistics in processing logs

### 4. Enhanced Logging System (`lib/assignment/logging.ts`)

**New Features:**
- Extended `PoolProcessingLogData` interface with error recovery data
- Corruption detection logging
- Fallback attempt tracking
- Health check result logging
- Retry success/failure tracking

### 5. Administrative API Endpoints

#### Pool Status API (`app/api/admin/pool/status/route.ts`)
- **GET /api/admin/pool/status**: Comprehensive pool status with error recovery information
- Includes pool statistics, processing status, error recovery health, and recommendations
- Real-time health assessment and diagnostic information

#### Emergency Processing API (`app/api/admin/pool/emergency-process/route.ts`)
- **POST /api/admin/pool/emergency-process**: Force immediate processing with maximum error recovery
- **GET /api/admin/pool/emergency-process**: Get emergency processing capabilities and recommendations
- Enhanced error recovery configuration for emergency situations

#### Health Check API (`app/api/admin/pool/health/route.ts`)
- **GET /api/admin/pool/health**: Comprehensive health check with detailed diagnostics
- **POST /api/admin/pool/health/repair**: Automated repair operations for detected issues
- Repair operations: cleanup stuck processing, reset excessive retries, cleanup corrupted entries, retry failed entries, validate pool integrity

### 6. Test Infrastructure

**Test Scripts:**
- `scripts/test-pool-error-recovery.js`: Comprehensive testing of error recovery features
- `scripts/test-error-recovery-simple.js`: Simple verification of error recovery system
- Database-based testing with corruption scenarios, retry logic, and health checks

## Key Features Implemented

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- Configurable maximum retry attempts (default: 3, emergency: 5)
- Exponential backoff: base delay 1000ms, max delay 30000ms
- Database tracking of processing attempts
- Automatic failure marking after max retries exceeded

### Error Isolation
- Individual entry processing in try-catch blocks
- Failed entries don't block processing of successful entries
- Batch processing continues even with partial failures
- Error categorization: DATABASE, CONFLICT, TIMEOUT, VALIDATION, NETWORK, BUSINESS_LOGIC, CORRUPTION, CRITICAL

### Corruption Detection and Cleanup
- **Detection Scenarios:**
  - Missing bookings in database
  - Data inconsistencies between pool and database
  - Invalid time relationships
  - Already assigned bookings still in pool
  - Excessive processing attempts
  - Logical inconsistencies

- **Cleanup Actions:**
  - Remove corrupted entries from pool
  - Fix missing pool status
  - Reset excessive processing attempts
  - Remove already assigned bookings
  - Database integrity repairs

### Fallback to Immediate Assignment
- Triggered when pool processing consistently fails
- Removes entries from pool and processes immediately
- Resets pool status to allow immediate assignment
- Comprehensive logging of fallback operations

### Health Checks and Monitoring
- **Database Connectivity**: Connection testing with response time measurement
- **Pool Integrity**: Validation of pool entries and status consistency
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time, success rate, error rate tracking
- **Error Statistics**: Recent failures, stuck processing, excessive retries
- **Recommendations**: Automated suggestions based on health status

### Configuration Management
- Runtime configuration of error recovery parameters
- Conservative, aggressive, and default configuration presets
- Per-operation configuration (emergency processing uses more aggressive settings)

## Error Recovery Workflow

1. **Pre-Processing Health Check**: Assess system health before processing
2. **Corruption Detection**: Check each entry for corruption before processing
3. **Retry Processing**: Process entries with exponential backoff retry logic
4. **Error Isolation**: Continue processing other entries if individual entries fail
5. **Fallback Processing**: Use immediate assignment for consistently failed entries
6. **Health Assessment**: Post-processing health check and recommendations
7. **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all recovery actions and outcomes

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Health Status Indicators
- **HEALTHY**: All systems operational, minimal issues
- **UNHEALTHY**: Critical issues detected, immediate attention required

### Error Recovery Metrics
- Total failures in last 24 hours
- High retry attempts count
- Stuck processing entries
- Corruption detection rate
- Fallback success rate

### Automated Repair Operations
- Cleanup stuck processing entries
- Reset excessive retry attempts
- Cleanup corrupted entries
- Retry failed entries
- Validate pool integrity
