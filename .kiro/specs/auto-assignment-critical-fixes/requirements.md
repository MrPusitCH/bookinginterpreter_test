# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical bugs in the auto-assignment system that are preventing proper operation. The system currently has three major issues: pooled bookings are not being processed for assignment, database schema errors are preventing DR policy logging, and mode switching from Balance to Urgent doesn't properly handle existing pooled bookings. These issues need immediate resolution to ensure the auto-assignment systaem functions correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pool Processing Execution Fix

**User Story:** As a booking administrator, I want pooled bookings to be automatically processed and assigned when they reach their thresholds, so that bookings don't remain stuck in the pool indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking is added to the pool THEN it SHALL be processed for assignment when it reaches its threshold time
2. WHEN pool processing runs THEN it SHALL actually assign interpreters to ready bookings
3. WHEN pool processing completes THEN it SHALL log the results to POOL_PROCESSING_LOG table
4. WHEN bookings reach their deadline THEN they SHALL be assigned immediately regardless of mode
5. IF pool processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with error logging and fallback to immediate assignment

### Requirement 2: Database Schema and Logging Fix

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want DR policy logging to work without database errors, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot DR assignment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DR policy decisions are made THEN they SHALL be logged to the database without errors
2. WHEN the system attempts to create DR policy logs THEN the database schema SHALL support the required fields
3. WHEN logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating but log the error for investigation
4. WHEN the database schema is missing required tables THEN clear error messages SHALL guide administrators to fix the schema
5. IF logging buffers become full THEN they SHALL be flushed successfully without blocking assignment operations

### Requirement 3: Mode Switching with Pool Handling

**User Story:** As a booking administrator, I want to switch from Balance mode to Urgent mode and have existing pooled bookings handled appropriately, so that urgent situations can be addressed without losing existing bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from Balance to Urgent mode THEN existing pooled bookings SHALL be re-evaluated for immediate assignment
2. WHEN in Urgent mode THEN new bookings SHALL be assigned immediately without pooling
3. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what happens to existing pooled bookings
4. WHEN urgent assignments are needed THEN the system SHALL process pool entries that meet urgent criteria immediately
5. IF mode switching occurs during pool processing THEN the system SHALL handle the transition gracefully without data loss

### Requirement 4: Pool Status Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into pool processing status and debugging information, so that I can identify and resolve pool-related issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing pool status THEN the system SHALL show current pool entries, their processing status, and next processing time
2. WHEN pool processing runs THEN detailed logs SHALL be created showing what was processed and the results
3. WHEN pool entries are stuck THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about why they're not being processed
4. WHEN debugging pool issues THEN administrators SHALL have access to pool entry history and processing attempts
5. IF pool processing is not running THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information

### Requirement 5: Auto-Approval Function Enhancement

**User Story:** As a booking administrator, I want an auto-approval function that works seamlessly with mode switching and pool processing, so that the system can handle varying workload demands automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-approval is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically switch modes based on configurable criteria
2. WHEN system load is high THEN auto-approval SHALL switch to Urgent mode to clear backlogs quickly
3. WHEN system load is normal THEN auto-approval SHALL use Balance mode for optimal fairness
4. WHEN switching modes automatically THEN existing pooled bookings SHALL be handled according to the new mode's rules
5. IF auto-approval detects issues THEN it SHALL provide notifications and allow manual override

### Requirement 6: Pool Processing Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want pool processing to be reliable and self-healing, so that the system continues to function even when individual processing attempts fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pool processing encounters errors THEN it SHALL retry failed entries with exponential backoff
2. WHEN database connections fail during pool processing THEN the system SHALL reconnect and continue processing
3. WHEN pool entries become corrupted THEN they SHALL be identified and either fixed or removed with logging
4. WHEN pool processing is interrupted THEN it SHALL resume from where it left off on restart
5. IF pool processing consistently fails THEN the system SHALL escalate to manual assignment with administrator notification

### Requirement 7: Configuration Validation for Pool Settings

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want pool-related configuration settings to be validated and provide clear feedback, so that I can configure the system correctly without causing pool processing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring threshold days THEN the system SHALL validate that values are reasonable and warn about potential issues
2. WHEN setting pool processing intervals THEN the system SHALL ensure they align with threshold settings
3. WHEN configuring mode-specific pool behavior THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of the impact
4. WHEN invalid pool configurations are detected THEN clear error messages SHALL guide administrators to correct settings
5. IF pool configuration changes affect existing pooled bookings THEN the system SHALL explain the impact and provide options

### Requirement 8: Emergency Pool Processing Override

**User Story:** As a booking administrator, I want the ability to force immediate processing of all pooled bookings in emergency situations, so that I can ensure coverage when urgent needs arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency processing is triggered THEN all pooled bookings SHALL be processed immediately regardless of thresholds
2. WHEN emergency processing runs THEN it SHALL prioritize bookings by urgency and deadline proximity
3. WHEN emergency processing completes THEN detailed results SHALL be provided showing what was assigned
4. WHEN emergency processing is used THEN the system SHALL log the reason and results for audit purposes
5. IF emergency processing fails for some bookings THEN they SHALL be escalated for manual assignment with clear reasons
